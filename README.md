# solar_system_Animation_Simulation
A simulation and visual representation of the solar system

Physics: Runge-Kutta 4
Graphics: OpenGL
global illumination algorithm, shading algorithm, collision algorithm, 
green screen for algorithm overlay

apallaktikh.cpp is the main C++ function

You can try apallaktikh.exe on the ~/apallaktikh folder in order
to preview the project

It includes windows libraries for the Star Wars sound
